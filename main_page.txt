To experience a gravity-type force, objects must be on the inside of the outer 
wall of the tube, so that there can be a centripetal force to move the objects 
in a circle. See the free-body diagram for an object on the inside of the outer 
wall and a portion of the tube. The normal force of contact between the 
object and the wall must be maintaining the circular motion. Write Newton’s 
second law for the radial direction.
